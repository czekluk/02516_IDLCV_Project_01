# 02516_IDLCV_Project_01

## Project Description

The goal of the project is to implement and compare different CNN-architectures and training-techniques for image classification. The task is to classify images based on if a hotdog is visible or not. The data used is a subset of the images from the ImageNet dataset.

Some examples are:

![hotdog](docs/chilidog%20(12).jpg) ![no hotdog](docs/food%20(15).jpg)

In this repository the training-data is stored in directory called `data\train`. The test-data is stored in `data\test`.

## To Do's

- [ ] Compare Architectures, Choice of Architecture, Modification of Architecture
- [ ] Trainingsetup, Parameterselection
- [ ] Compare Optimizers
- [ ] Data Augmentation
- [ ] Batch Normalisation
- [ ] Accuracy assessment, wrong classifications + interpretation
- [ ] Transfer learning
- [ ] Saliency maps for best model + discussion of saliency maps
- [ ] how was CHatGPT used?
